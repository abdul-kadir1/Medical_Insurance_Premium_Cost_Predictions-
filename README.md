# Health Insurance Cost Prediction Model
![Health Insurance](health_insu.jpg)
## Project Overview:
This project aims to predict health insurance costs based on various features such as age, sex, BMI, smoking status, and other health factors. We built a predictive model using machine learning techniques to provide insights into healthcare expenses, making it easier for individuals and insurance companies to estimate premiums.

## Key Features:
### Predictive Model: 
The core of this project is a machine learning model trained on health-related data. It predicts the insurance cost based on features like age, sex, BMI, smoking habits, diabetes, and exercise frequency.

### Interactive Web App: 
To make the model accessible, I developed an interactive Streamlit app where users can input their details and get personalized insurance cost predictions. The app is live and can be accessed through the following link:

## Objective:
The goal of this project is to understand how different factors affect health insurance premiums and provide a predictive tool for future users. The application is user-friendly and allows individuals to enter their health data to estimate their potential insurance costs.

## Methodology:
We employed multiple machine learning algorithms to build an accurate model for predicting insurance costs:

### 1.Linear Regression: 
We started with a simple yet effective approach using Linear Regression. This algorithm assumes a linear relationship between the input features and the target (insurance cost), and it provides an initial baseline for performance.

### 2.Decision Tree Regressor:
The second model we tested was the Decision Tree Regressor. This model uses a tree-like structure to make decisions and can capture non-linear relationships between the input features and the target. It is especially useful when dealing with complex data patterns.

### 3.Random Forest Regressor: 
To further improve the model's accuracy, we used the Random Forest Regressor, an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees. It tends to provide better performance and reduces the risk of overfitting compared to individual decision trees.

After training all three models, we compared their performance and selected the one that best predicted the insurance costs based on the test data.

## Technologies Used:
###### Python : for building the model and app.
###### Scikit-learn for machine learning (Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor).
###### Streamlit for creating the interactive web app.
###### NumPy, Pandas for data manipulation and processing.
###### Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualizations.

## How to Use the App:
Go to the live app link: 
[Health Insurance Cost Prediction App](https://insurancecost.streamlit.app/#health-insurance-cost-prediction-model)
###### Enter your health details (age, sex, weight, BMI, etc.) into the provided input fields.
###### Click on the "Predict" button to see your estimated health insurance cost.
###### You can adjust the inputs and try various combinations to see how different factors affect the predicted cost.

## Acknowledgments:
I would like to express my gratitude to our mentor, Mayank Singh Sir, for his guidance and support throughout the project. A special thanks to my team members for their dedication and hard work. Without their collaboration, this project wouldnâ€™t have been possible.
